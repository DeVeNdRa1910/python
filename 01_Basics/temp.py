# Here we just import the function from hello.py to use it in this file. But when we run this file a new folder is created called __pycache__ which contains the compiled version of hello.py. This is done to speed up the import process. The compiled file is named hello.cpython-39.pyc (the number may vary depending on your python version). This file is not meant to be edited and should not be deleted. It will be recreated automatically when you run the code again.

# The __pycache__ folder is created in the same directory as the original file. It contains the compiled version of the file, which is used to speed up the import process. The compiled file is named hello.cpython-39.pyc (the number may vary depending on your python version). This file is not meant to be edited and should not be deleted.
