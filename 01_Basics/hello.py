# Everything in python is an object
# When we initialize a variable(let x = 10), Then it will aqcuire a memory location and 10 is store in that memory location and x have reference to that memory location now we are create one more variable y (y = x) then y will also point to the same memory location where 10 is stored. So if we change the value of x(x = 15) then a new memory location will be created and 15 will be stored in that memory location and x will point to that memory location but y will still point to the old memory location where 10 is stored. So if we print x and y then it will print 15 and 10 respectively.

# In python everything is an object and all the variables are references to the objects. So when we assign a variable to another variable then both will point to the same memory location. So if we change the value of one variable then it will create a new memory location and the other variable will still point to the old memory location.
